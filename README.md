This is some materials I am putting together for my Soc 722 course where we are using Richard McElreath's _Statistical Rethinking_ (2nd edition). A lot of it is me trying to combine `quap()` with a tidy workflow before we get to MCMC.

The `oldstuff` folder is stuff from previous iterations. I honestly have no recollection of what's in there!
